# Track Processing

## Project Overview

Track Processing is designed to manage and monitor data processing pipelines with a focus on ensuring data integrity, optimizing performance, and supporting robust and scalable data infrastructure. This project encompasses task scheduling, error handling, and real-time analytics, aiming to enhance the efficiency and reliability of data workflows.

## Features

- **Data Pipeline Management**: Streamline the process of moving data through various transformation stages.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure accuracy and consistency of data throughout the pipeline.
- **Performance Optimization**: Maximize the efficiency of data processing tasks.
- **Task Scheduling**: Automate the execution of data processing tasks.
- **Error Handling**: Robust mechanisms for detecting and managing errors.
- **Real-time Analytics**: Gain insights into data processing in real time to support decision-making.

## Installation

To set up the Track Processing project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/track-processing.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```sh
    cd track-processing
    ```
3. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```sh
    # Using pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Using conda
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate track-processing
    ```

## Usage

1. **Configuration:**
    Ensure that the configuration file (`config.yaml`) is set up correctly with your data sources and processing parameters.

2. **Running the Pipeline:**
    ```sh
    python run_pipeline.py
